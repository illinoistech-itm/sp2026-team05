### You will need to provide a markdown document named: About.md in the root of the team repository. This document will describe the general scope and outline of the project.

Our app PhotoLeague is a pintrest clone, which is a photo sharing app were you can publish and group photos together. Our app will have a drag and drop feature to upload images, a group image feature, and a tagging img feature. 

For our Database we will be running: PostgresSQL as the application database and Google Storage for the images.

### In the About.md add a paragraph or two describing the general function of your proposed project. No programming or code design is required at this time.
