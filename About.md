### You will need to provide a markdown document named: About.md in the root of the team repository. This document will describe the general scope and outline of the project.

This project will be a pintrest clone, which is a photo sharing app. It'll have a drag and drop feature to add images, a group image feature and a Log in page. 

### In the About.md add a paragraph or two describing the general function of your proposed project. No programming or code design is required at this time.
